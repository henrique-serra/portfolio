                    <p>Hello! I'm Henrique Serra, a passionate full-stack web developer with over 5 years of experience creating digital solutions that combine functionality with elegant design. Based in Brazil, I specialize in modern web technologies and have a deep appreciation for clean code and intuitive user experiences.</p>
                    
                    <p>My journey in web development began with a curiosity about how websites work, which quickly evolved into a passion for building applications that solve real-world problems. I believe that great software should be both powerful and accessible, with interfaces that feel natural and code that stands the test of time.</p>

                    <p>I approach every project with a user-first mindset, ensuring that technical excellence never comes at the expense of usability. Whether I'm architecting a complex backend system or crafting a pixel-perfect frontend interface, I maintain focus on performance, accessibility, and maintainability.</p>
                    
                    <p>Continuous learning is at the core of my professional growth. The web development landscape evolves rapidly, and I stay current with emerging technologies while maintaining expertise in established frameworks and best practices.</p>
